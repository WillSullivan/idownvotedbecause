# [idownvotedbecau.se](http://idownvotedbecau.se)
Let others know why you downvoted, why it was worth a downvote, and what improvements can be made.

Each page addresses a single reason why someone would downvote a post.  It includes a description of what was wrong, why it is a problem, and why the community in general thinks it is worth a downvote.  

The reader is also given ways to fix the problem, and is encouraged to do so.  The reader is also encouraged to let the person who left the link know afterwards so they can retract their downvote.

If you would like to add a page, please do so!  You can open an issue to suggest a topic, or add one yourself and send a pull request.

There's a [template](https://github.com/WillSullivan/idownvotedbecause/blob/master/PostTemplate) for new pages, and [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/WillSullivan/idownvotedbecause/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) contains information about how pages should be written.

This website is for your benefit, and the benefit of all others in your reputation-based community.
