---title: I downvoted because...byline: a website designed to help you help others!---# This website is designed to help people understand why you downvoted.Participation in a reputation-ranked online community comes with its ups and downs. You post something and it gets upvoted when people like or agree with it--*and that's great!* Unfortunately, it may also recieve a downvote because **someone didn't.**Maybe your post got downvoted, and you're wondering why. Or maybe you're the downvoter, and you want to let the person who owns the post why you downvoted. This website is **built for you.**The goal for *I Downvoted Because* is to give people an **easy, productive and helpful way** to let someone know **what caused your downvote, what they can do to fix it, and why you think they should do so.** It also gives people who experience downvotes a simple way to learn what happened and why. They can also learn what the culture of a community sees as a reason to downvote, and therefore how to reverse it. ## How does this website work? This website hosts one page per reason for a downvote. Each reason has its own URL in the format> IDownvotedBecause.com/ashortdescriptionofwhyWhen you wish to let someone know why you downvoted and how they could reverse it, simply leave a link to the relevant page.You can browse our current list of reasons, sorted by community, [here](/allreasons/). Can't find your specific reason?
