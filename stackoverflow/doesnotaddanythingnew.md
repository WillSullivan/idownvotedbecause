## Make sure your answers add something new. {introduction}
When you answer a question, read previous answers before. If you don't have anything to add, then don't answer. If you have something new to add that is very minor, consider editing an existing answer instead. If your answer is considerably better or different, then post it.

## Why this is a problem {#whythisisaproblem}
Repeating just adds noise. Noise makes it harder to find valuable content.

## Why this is worth a downvote {#whythisisworthadownvote}
Since your post hade very little or no additional value with regard to existing answers, it should not have been posted in the first place. Posting answers like this gives the impression that you're just hunting reputation without the intention of making the site better.

## What to do next {#whattodonext}
Read the question carefully. Then read all existing answers. If you have nothing to add, then add nothing. If your contribution is very minor or simply aims to correct an existing answer, consider editing the existing answer instead of posting a new one.

## Leave a comment! {#leaveacomment}
Once you have done this, leave a comment to the person who sent you this link. They will be happy to retract their downvote.
