## "It's not working" is not helpful {#introduction}
When someone asks a question about a problem with their code, we need to know what is wrong with it. Stating that "it doesn't work" is not helpful.

## Why this is a problem {#whythisisaproblem}
In order to provide a solution, we need a full description of the problem. That includes

 1. What you are trying to accomplish
 2. What you have tried (including a [minimal, complete, and verifiable example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve))
 3. A description of what the code did
 4. A description of why this does not achieve your goal

"It didn't work" is not an adequate description for points 3 and/or 4.

If the problem is not directly code-related, be sure to include details about your attempts to fix the problem, what the results were, and what you expected to happen instead. Any relevant errors should be included in the question.

## Why this is worth a downvote {#whythisisworthadownvote}
When one of these items is not provided, answerers have to guess what the missing pieces are. That increases the chances that their answers are incorrect, which is a waste of everyone's time. Without enough information to answer a question, experienced users are less likely to attempt to answer, and more likely to downvote. 

## What to do next {#whattodonext}
Review your question. Did you provide a full description of what the code did? Did you point out the reasons why this result was not correct? Use the edit link at the bottom of your question (do *not* add a comment!) to provide these details. If commenters have asked pointed questions about what happened and why it wasn't correct, make sure to address these questions directly.

If you do not know *why* your code did not work, that suggests you have not debugged it. Debugging is one of the first steps developers take when their code fails, and is an important skill to learn. Not debugging your code is also worth a downvote. To learn why, and for hints on how to debug your code, see our ["No Debugging" page](http://idownvotedbecau.se/nodebugging/).
