## "It's not working" is not helpful {#introduction}
When asking a question about a problem with some code, people will need to know exactly what is wrong with it, in as much detail as possible. Stating that "it doesn't work" is not helpful.

## Why this is a problem {#whythisisaproblem}
In order to provide a solution, answerers need a full description of the problem. That includes a [minimal, complete, and verifiable example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) containing the faulty code, as well as the following

 1. What the code is trying to accomplish
 2. What the code actually did when tested or executed
 3. A description of why this did not achieve this goal, and
 4. What attempts were made to fix this problem, and what results they gave

"It didn't work" is not an adequate description for points 2, 3 and 4.

If the problem is not directly code-related, the question needs to include details about attempts to fix the problem, what the results were, and what was expected to happen instead. Any relevant errors should always be included in the question.

## Why this is worth a downvote {#whythisisworthadownvote}
When one or more of these items are not provided, answerers have to guess what the missing pieces are. That increases the chances that their answers are incorrect, which is a wastes their time and prevents the asker from getting a correct answer. Without enough information to answer a question, experienced users are less likely to attempt to answer, and more likely to downvote. 

## What to do next {#whattodonext}
Review the question. Does it provide a full description of what the code did? Does it include the reasons why this was not correct? If more details can be provided, there is an edit button at the bottom of the question that can be used to add these details. Updates like this should not be added to comments. If commenters have asked pointed questions about what happened and why it wasn't correct, these questions should be answered directly and promptly.

If it is unclear *why* the code did not work, that suggests it has not been debugged. Debugging is one of the first steps developers take when their code fails, and is an important skill to learn. Asking for help before attempting to debug is also seen by many to be worth a downvote. To learn why, and for hints on how to debug code, see our ["No Debugging" page](http://idownvotedbecau.se/nodebugging/).
