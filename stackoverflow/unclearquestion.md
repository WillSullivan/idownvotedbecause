## Before we can help you, you must help us {#introduction}
Sometimes questions aren't as clear as they should be. Or, they may not contain important information needed to provide a correct answer. Or, they do not contain a question at all. Or the formatting is so bad that are extremely difficult to read at all. When you write a question, before clicking submit, you should put yourself in someone else's shoes. Do you think you are able to understand what are you asking?

## Why this is a problem {#whythisisaproblem}
Without a clear question and a clear picture of the problem, it is less likely that the question will be answered. By not providing insightful question, people who are willing to help are either not going to answer, or their answers will be educated guesses. If these guesses are incorrect, they've wasted their time, and the question will remain without a valid solution. The problem reflects also in other people seeking a solution for their problem, forced to navigate in a sea of unclear questions with presumably low-quality answers.

## Why this is worth a downvote {#whythisisworthadownvote}
If a question is important enough to ask, it should be important enough to promptly check it actually goes to the point. Anything else is essentially cluttering the site with not useful pages that will cover quality questions. The time spent in analyzing a question is wasted time. If answerers hazard an answer that ends up being incorrect, the time spent on that is wasted. Wasting the time of people who are trying to help is seen as rude. 

## What to do next {#whattodonext}
Edit the question to clarify and make it understandable for anyone is reading it, and then @reply in the comments to let the people know that their requests for clarification have been answered. And, in the future, when asking a question, read at least twice the question before submitting it, considering the point of view of someone that does not have all the information that you have, but will have to reply only on the basis of what is written in your question. Remember to include a Minimal, Complete, Verifiable Example (MCVE). Use the formatting to make the question easily readable. Don't forget to check to see if comments or answers have been added every ten to fifteen minutes and always edit your question if someone raises a request for clarification. Doing so raises the chances they will provide an answer, as well as the probability that the answer is a correct solution, and it will become a solution also for someone else in future.
