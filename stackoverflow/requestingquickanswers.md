## Requesting quick answers adds noise {#introduction}
Stack Overflow is NOT a chat site, and not a forum. Refrain from adding unhelpful information like "this is urgent".

## Why this is a problem {#whythisisaproblem}
Questions on Stack Overflow are never prioritised. Information such as "I am under a tight deadline" is not useful - only relevant information should be added to a question. If a question makes someone feel bad (with "my manager is mad at me" et al), they may get pressured into answering, which is not what Stack Overflow is about - people should never be forced to answer.

## Why this is worth a downvote {#whythisisworthadownvote}
Chats are much better for time-sensitive questions, as they're designed to give quick answers. Stack Overflow is meant for people to share information, not for people to get a quick and easy answer. Finally, things like "Please reply ASAP!" are not useful to future readers, which is the opposite of Stack Overflow's goal.

## What to do next {#whattodonext}
Edit the question to remove the sense of urgency. Adding a bounty to your question may help to get quicker answers, but that relies on relatively large amounts of reputation.
