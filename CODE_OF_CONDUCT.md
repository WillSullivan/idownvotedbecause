# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

Pages must strictly focus on factual reasons as to why a question or answer is of poor quality.

They must **not** make asumptions that could shed a dire light on users of Stack Overflow or other sites.  
For example, this is _not acceptable_:

> Homework questions show laziness and often attract downvotes.

This is making the asumption that OP is lazy. Not only is it useless, it can also make readers feel insulted or targetted. Instead:

> Homework questions are often frowned upon by users and have to go an extra mile to show quality.

In general, avoid targetting users in any way. Readers of IDB are likely to be upset and triggering them more won't contribute to their learning.
